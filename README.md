We all know that getting an internship or a job is challenging, and often these online courses do wonders in making our resume look good. Since unpaid courses are accessible to everyone, they help many people further their learning, learn new skills, and polish their existing skills. Academic knowledge might not be enough in today’s society. You need to show the world that you have experimented in your life and have enriching experiences. A lot of opportunities open up when you start getting involved in professional activities like training and courses.<br>
<br>
After many days of work, I have collected some free courses with certificates in different domains. You can enroll in any course of your choice and get the certificate to add it to your resume or Linkedin.

Website-https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x<br>
<br>
edX- An introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.<br>
 This is CS50x , Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. The on-campus version of CS50x , CS50, is Harvard's largest course.
 
 Students who earn a satisfactory score on 9 problem sets (i.e., programming assignments) and a final project are eligible for a certificate. This is a self-paced course–you may take CS50x on your own schedule.
