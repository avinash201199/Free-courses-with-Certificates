{
    "cards": [

            "name": "Angular + NestJS",
            "source": "Sololearn",
            "link": "https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1092"
        }
    ]
},
```

```json
{
    "title": "New Course Title",
    "cards": [
        {
            "icon": "Get this value from fontawesome.com (Make sure to add classes only)",
            "name": "New Course",
            "source": "New Course Source",
