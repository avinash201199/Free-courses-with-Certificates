# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, are committed to creating a respectful and inclusive community on GitHub. We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are dedicated to fostering an open, welcoming, diverse, and healthy community where all individuals can collaborate and thrive.

## Our Expectations

We expect all community members to uphold the following standards of behavior:

- **Empathy and Kindness**: Treat others with empathy and kindness. Show respect for differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.

- **Constructive Feedback**: Give and receive constructive feedback gracefully. Accept responsibility for mistakes, apologize to those affected, and learn from the experience.

- **Community Focus**: Prioritize the well-being and growth of the overall community, not just individual interests.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

- **Sexualized Behavior**: Using sexualized language, imagery, or making sexual advances of any kind.

- **Trolling and Harassment**: Engaging in trolling, insulting, derogatory comments, or personal and political attacks.

- **Public or Private Harassment**: Engaging in public or private harassment of any individual.

- **Privacy Violation**: Publishing others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without explicit permission.

- **Inappropriate Conduct**: Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for enforcing these standards of behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting Violations

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [contact@email.com]. All complaints will be promptly and fairly reviewed and investigated.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Enforcement Guidelines in determining consequences for any action deemed in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other unprofessional behavior.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity on the violation's nature and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.
